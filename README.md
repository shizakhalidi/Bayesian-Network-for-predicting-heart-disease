# Bayesian-Network-for-predicting-heart-disease

This Bayesian Ntwork file is developed in and will work in GeNie Software

## Description:
Following is a simplified description of causal relationships of heart disease amongst patients.
Heart diseases can be caused by a number of factors. One such factor is high blood pressure,
which can happen due to excessive smoking, a lack of physical exercise and obesity. Other
major causes of heart diseases are atherosclerosis and low protein concentrations.
Atherosclerosis restricts the flow of oxygen to the heart. People with high cholesterol levels,
high triglycerides and obesity have a higher chance of being diagnosed with atherosclerosis.
People who don’t exercise regularly and have an unbalanced diet are prone to being obese.
Low protein levels are a resultant of not having enough protein based foods in your diet.
Genetic factors also play some role in having a heart disease. In order to detect heart diseases,
ECG (Electrocardiogram) is used to assess heart rate and rhythm. Heart diseases can lead to
many problems, such as heart attack, angina and stroke.

## Questions:
The following questions can be asked:-
1. If a person who is a chain smoker and he doesn’t exercise at all, then what are the
chances of him acquiring a heart disease?
2. A person is continuously stressed. He doesn’t have atherosclerosis, obesity nor does he
smoke, but due to stress he has high blood pressure. What is the probability that his
ECG will be abnormal?
3. A woman had a stroke. She doesn’t smoke, she didn’t have high blood pressure, and no
one in her family ever had a heart disease. What are the chances the woman suffered
from obesity?
4. A man had a heart attack, his blood pressure is high and he has a family history of heart
diseases. What lifestyle changes can he make to reduce the chances of having another
heart attack?
5. I don’t have time for exercise, I don’t smoke, I eat healthy generally and I am not obese.
Many of my family members have had heart diseases. What is the probability that I will
have a heart disease?
